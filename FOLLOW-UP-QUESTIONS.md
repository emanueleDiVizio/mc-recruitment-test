# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add? What are they used for?

### Q) How do I run the application?

---

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

# My notes:

- I am wary of having the reduc connection only implemented in the `screens` folder, as I've found that connecting small components to reduc through `hooks` is very efficient these days.
